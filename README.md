# Mental-Health-App---Hygieia
Hygieia is a mental health app that helps people with psychological issues, and not just that, to communicate with doctors for medical appointments and other people with shared experiences.
In the app interface people can participate in an online consultation, having the possibility to make appointments, discuss through a video conference with a selected doctor from our app and view a report containing all the details of the consultation and the medical prescription, created by the specialist. You can also engage with people who have had similar experiences via a forum. 

Framework used: ASP.NET MVC

Also I worked with C#, CSS, HTML, JavaScript and JQuery library.
